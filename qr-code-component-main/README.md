## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I am still trying to figure out the best ways to utilize margin and padding.  I placed the image in a div container and gave the container padding.
```css
.qr-code {
  padding: 0.5rem 0.5rem;
}
```
I put the text in a div container and gave the container margin.
```css
.text {
  text-align: center;
  margin: 0 0.75rem 0.5rem 0.75rem;
}
```
I tend to use a lot of div containers to separate different sections.

### Continued development

My goal is to build a strong foundation in CSS. I used Flexbox for this project. In the future I would like to use grid.  I'd also like to be able to use the box model more effectively.
